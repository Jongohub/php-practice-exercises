# PHP back-end exercises focusing on superglobals

Exercise 1: Form Handling
Create a simple HTML form that takes a user's name and email address. When the form is submitted, use PHP to process the data and display a personalized message with the user's name and email.

Exercise 2: User Registration
Build a user registration system using PHP. The form should collect a username, password, and email. Validate the input and display appropriate error messages for any invalid fields. Store the registered user's information in a text file or database.

Exercise 3: Login System
Implement a login system using PHP. Create a login form that takes a username and password. Validate the credentials against the registered users' data from the previous exercise. On successful login, display a welcome message with the user's name.

Exercise 4: File Upload and Processing
Design a file upload form using PHP. Allow users to upload an image file and save it to a designated folder on the server. Display the uploaded image on the webpage after successful upload.

Exercise 5: Contact Form with Email
Create a contact form that collects a user's name, email address, and message. Validate the form data, and when the form is submitted, send the user's message to a designated email address using PHP's mail() function.

Exercise 6: Data Filtering and Sanitization
Build a form that takes user input for an age and a comment. Use PHP to filter and sanitize the age input to ensure it's a valid integer within a specific range. Apply sanitization to the comment input to prevent potential security risks like cross-site scripting (XSS).

Exercise 7: Session Management
Implement a simple login system with sessions. Create a login form that takes a username and password, validate them against stored user data, and use sessions to maintain the user's login state across pages.

Exercise 8: Shopping Cart
Design a basic shopping cart system using PHP sessions. Allow users to add products to the cart, display the cart contents, and calculate the total cost of selected items.

Exercise 9: Data Pagination
Create a PHP script that fetches data from a database table and displays it with pagination. Limit the number of displayed records per page and provide navigation links to move between pages.

Exercise 10: API Integration
Integrate with a public API using PHP. For example, fetch weather data from a weather API and display it on your webpage.
